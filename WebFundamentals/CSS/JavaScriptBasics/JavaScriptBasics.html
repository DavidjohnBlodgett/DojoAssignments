        <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
        <p id="overview">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
lightweight language allowing maximum ﬂexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over
them.</p>
        <ul id="mainList">
            <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a><p>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you ﬁll with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
a variable holds a value. All J avaScript variables must be identiﬁed with unique names. These unique names are called identiﬁers.<span> var x;</span></p></li>
            <li><a href="#"></a>Variable Assignment<p>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our
variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span> var x = 10;</span></p></li>
            <li><a href="#">Data Types</a><p>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types
that are J avaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null -<span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>
 Array - <span>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']</span> and Object - <span>{first_name: 'Jane',last_name: 'Doe'}</span></p></li>
            <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a><p>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on
values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
conditional statements: <span>if</span> a speciﬁed condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the ﬁrst
condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</p></li>
            <li><a href="#">Loops</a><p>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</p></li>
            <li><a href="#">Function</a><p>Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of
instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, ﬁrst we
screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We ﬁnished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more
tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</p></li>
